# Sucuri-Cloudproxy-Bypass
5 Minutes script to bypass Sucuri Cloudproxy in Python by using js2py

Simply install the needed libraries, cd in the directory and run the script with python3 main.py ...
You can easily integrate this in your projects ecc...
Might rewrite it as a module that you can simply import at a later point....

If they patch anything open an issue and I might fix it
Don't write me asking how to run this, learn your basics first please
